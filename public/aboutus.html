        What is Formula 1?
        </h1>
      <p>
        The air around you is electric, charged with the energy and anticipation of tens of millions around the globe. Hearts pound, adrenaline surges, and in those fleeting 
        seconds, those five red lights illuminate themselves one by one, the world holds its breath, you hear the roars of the cars go to an ear-shattering 15,000 revolutions.
        The last of the five red lights light up, tension peaks, and then it happens, the commentator speaks, "and it's LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO FOR THE BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX".
        At the snap of a finger, chaos erupts, tires screech, and you see the cars of the pinnacle of motorsport driven by the world's best drivers race away at speeds exceeding
        200 miles per hour. This is Formula 1. Are you ready to feel the rush?

      </h1>
      <p>
        We intend to use this website as a comprehensive resource for most aspects of Formula 1. Aiming to provide information on the basics, for viewers who are only starting 
        to get into the sport,such as details about the drivers, the tracks, the technology, and most importantly, THE HISTORY, and latest news of Formula 1. Moreover, we will also aim to adopt
        more in-depth information for those who are already well-rooted in the motorsport, with information on deep technological advances in the sport, the engineering behind it,
        as well as all of the strategy, logistics, and drama involved. In summary, we want to give the first-time user a comprehensive understanding of the sport while also
