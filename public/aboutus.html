        What is Formula 1?
        </h1>
      <p>
        The air around you is electric, charged with the energy and anticipation of tens of millions around the globe. Hearts pound, adrenaline surges, and in those fleeting 
        seconds, those five red lights illuminate themselves one by one, the world holds its breath, you hear the roars of the cars go to an ear-shattering 15,000 revolutions.
        The last of the five red lights light up, tension peaks, and then it happens, the commentator speaks, "and it's LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO FOR THE BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX".
        At the snap of a finger, chaos erupts, tires screech, and you see the cars of the pinnacle of motorsport driven by the world's best drivers race away at speeds exceeding
        200 miles per hour. This is Formula 1. Are you ready to feel the rush?

        as well as all of the strategy, logistics, and drama involved. In summary, we want to give the first-time user a comprehensive understanding of the sport while also
