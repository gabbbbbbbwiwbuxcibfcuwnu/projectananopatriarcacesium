        The 2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, held on December 8 at the Yas Marina Circuit, concluded the Formula 1 season with notable developments. Lando Norris of McLaren secured a commanding victory, leading the team to its first Constructors' Championship in 26 years. 
        Norris maintained his lead from pole position, finishing ahead of Ferrari drivers Carlos Sainz Jr. and Charles Leclerc, who took second and third places respectively. This win marked Norris's fourth of the season and was pivotal in McLaren surpassing Ferrari by 14 points in the Constructors' standings

        The race featured significant incidents, including a first-corner collision where Oscar Piastri, Norris's teammate, was spun by Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Verstappen received a 10-second penalty for the incident and finished sixth, while Piastri recovered to secure the final point in tenth place.
        Lewis Hamilton, in his final race with Mercedes before his move to Ferrari, delivered a strong performance by climbing from 16th on the grid to finish fourth, overtaking teammate George Russell in the closing stages.
